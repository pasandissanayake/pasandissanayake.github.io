### About
I am currently a second-year PhD student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/)(UMD), advised by [Prof. Sanghamitra Dutta](https://sites.google.com/site/sanghamitraweb/). My research interests lie in the area of *responsible and trustworthy machine learning*. I am particularly interested in using tools from information theory, statistics and optimization in explaining ML models and data, achieving privacy, and formulating the notions of fairness.

I received BSc in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering from the [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/), Sri Lanka (UoM) in 2021, where I graduated with a *first class*. Prior to joining UMD, I was a Lecturer-on-Contract and a Research Assistant in UoM. During this time, my focus was on wireless communication and statistical signal processing. My research adviser was [Dr. Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa](https://sites.google.com/view/prathapasinghe/home). My undergraduate thesis project was advised by [Dr. Peshala Jayasekara](https://peshala.staff.uom.lk/projects/) and [Dr. Ranga Rodrigo](https://ent.uom.lk/team/dr-ranga-rodrigo/).

I was awarded the Dean's Fellowship (UMD) for the year 2022-2023 and was included in the Dean's List (UoM) from 2017 to 2021 (all 8 semesters).
