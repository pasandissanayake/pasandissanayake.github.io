### About
I am currently a third-year PhD student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/) (UMD), advised by [Prof. Sanghamitra Dutta](https://sites.google.com/site/sanghamitraweb/). My research interests lie in the area of *trustworthy machine learning*. I am particularly interested in developing novel strategies for reconstructing simpler and efficient models from larger, complex models while integrating explainability in this context. My research uses tools from optimization, statistics, and information theory to advance the foundations of trust and transparency. I also seek empirical validation of my strategies through carefully designed experiments.

I received BSc in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering from the [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/), Sri Lanka (UoM) in 2021, where I graduated with a *first class*. Prior to joining UMD, I was a Lecturer-on-Contract and a Research Assistant at UoM. During this time, my focus was on wireless communication and statistical signal processing. My research adviser was [Dr. Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa](https://sites.google.com/view/prathapasinghe/home). My undergraduate thesis project was advised by [Dr. Peshala Jayasekara](https://peshala.staff.uom.lk/projects/) and [Dr. Ranga Rodrigo](https://ent.uom.lk/team/dr-ranga-rodrigo/).

I was awarded the *Outstanding Research Assistant Award* (UMD) for the academic year 2024-2025 ,the *Dean's Fellowship* (UMD) for the year 2022-2023 and was included in the *Dean's List* (UoM) in years 2017 to 2021 (all 8 semesters).
